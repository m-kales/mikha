					<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>
						I am a front-end web developer with a passion for creating engaging
						and intuitive user experiences living in Odense, Denmark with my
						girlfriend and our two boys. As a team member I am helpful and eager
						to learn, and I like to be part of the decision making process
						taking responsibility for what I am involved in feeling a strong
						sense of ownership and accountability. I am a strong communicator,
						able to work closely with designers, backend developers, and
						stakeholders to deliver felicitous web experiences. Dedicated to
						staying uptodate with the latest web development trends and
						technologies, I am always looking to hone my skills and acquire new
						ones, and I hope to work with colleagues in an environment in which
						I can draw upon the experience of seniors as well as helping others
						learn. My passion for problemsolving and attention to detail make me
						a valuable asset to any team. For me, the most important aspects of
						a job are freedom, responsibility and opportunity for growth. I
						pursue simplicity and aesthetics in everything I do.

					<h2>Work history</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Frontend developer - Plan2Fy:</h3>
							I have worked for the past 1+ year as part of a team on a SaaS
							platform creating tools for drone pilots and bringing their
							services closer to customers. During that time I worked on legacy
							code and, in collaboration with UX-designer and backend team,
							modifed existing features as well as developing new ones. The
							process was agile, and we managed to continuously adjust to the
							needs of users and stakeholders.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Frontend developer internship - Edentic:</h3>
							Collaborating with more experienced developers taught me about the
							vast possibilities of my feld and the value of narrowing my focus.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Owner, designer, developer - Grasærk Media:</h3>
							Working with various clients on projects involving graphic/web
							design and development I learned about the importance of
							communication and expectation management.
						</li>
						<li>
							Master of Order - Coworking Plus: I was a part of growing this
							coworking space into the largest startup hub in Southern Denmark
							during a major growth spurt. I rolled up my sleeves and took care
							of whatever was needed. Working with the architect/designer, I was
							involved in the design of the physical as well as digital
							identity. Every day, I worked to create meaningful experiences for
							the users of the space.
						</li>
						<li>
							Multimedia designer internship - EYO Productions: I worked with
							graphic design, motion graphics and web design/development in a
							fast moving creative environment.
